I was especially impressed by your close reading of key passages and your attention to literary devices such as symbolism and foreshadowing. However, there are moments where your argument would benefit from clearer topic sentences and more consistent transitions between paragraphs. Be sure to also support your interpretations with textual evidence throughout, even in sections where your insights seem intuitive. Overall, this is a strong and promising paper with room for refinement in organization and depth of analysis."
