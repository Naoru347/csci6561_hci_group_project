# User Journey Genaral Overview

## Introduction
This document outlines the user journey for a task-based system, likely designed for a digital platform. The journey covers authentication, task selection, instructions, task execution, and task completion tracking. The explanation below provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the user's interaction with the system.

## 1. Authentication
Before accessing the system, the user must authenticate using a username and password. This step ensures secure access and may include additional security measures such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or biometric verification.

## 2. Task Selection
After authentication, the user is directed to the **task selection page**. Here, they are presented with multiple options:

- **New Composition Task** – Users can start a new writing or composition task.
- **Callable Task Options** – Users may select from predefined tasks.
- **Saved Tasks** – Users returning to the system can access previously saved work to continue where they left off.

## 3. Instructions Page
Once a task is selected, the user is redirected to an **instructions page**. This page provides detailed information about the task, including:

- The objective of the task.
- Guidelines and requirements.
- Expected output format.
- Any constraints such as time limits or word count.

## 4. Task Execution
After reviewing the instructions, the task begins automatically. Users engage in the following actions:

- **Composition Phase** – Users input or generate content based on the instructions.
- **Editing and Refining** – Users can review, edit, and refine their work before submission.
- **Task Save & Exit** – If needed, users can save their progress and exit, allowing them to return later to complete the task.

## 5. Task Completion and Submission
Once satisfied with their work, the user has two options:

- **Submit Task** – The final version is sent for review, grading, or processing.
- **Save & Exit** – The task remains available for further modifications before final submission.

## 6. Task Tracking and Review
Users can check the status of their tasks to differentiate between:

- **Completed Tasks** – Tasks that have been submitted and processed.
- **Incomplete Tasks** – Tasks that are saved but not yet submitted.

Users may also have access to feedback or results for completed tasks, allowing them to refine their approach in future tasks.

## Conclusion
This structured user journey ensures a clear and efficient process for task execution. By providing step-by-step guidance, progress tracking, and task management options, the system supports users in completing their objectives smoothly and effectively.
