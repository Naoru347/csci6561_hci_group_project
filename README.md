# Design Read-me & Documentation Notes

## Project Management
For project management, we utilized a highly collaborative team approach with members sharing roughly equally in the majority of tasks through a primary owner/contributor model. In this model, the primary owner would be responsible for between 51-75% of a given sub-task and contributors expected to contribute the remaining 25-49% of effort. The goal being that, on average, each group member contributed equally to project labor. 

To aid in this, we made regular use of GitHub projects to assign tasks, manage project deliverables, and maintain open, clear communication (see Figure, below, for an early example)

## Documentation Notes
This section outlines early thoughts on what to include in final documentation to be submitted upon project submission.
### Documentation Reqs per Assignment Prompt
- File Name: conceptual_model.pdf
- Front matter: Each group members name on top of page (ABC, Ascending)
- Outline of what users can do - 20%
- Concepts needed to understand how to interact - 20%
- Functionality - 20%
- Description of intended user experience - 20%
- Metaphor and interaction types - 20%

Note for each section be prepared to:
- Justify design decisions
- Discuss possible issues related to course terms (see note below for an example)
- Discuss group members roles/ownership

### Notes
- Discuss the choice of the stop light as metaphor
   - What *inclusivity* issues might exist?
   - What *accessibility issues might exist?
      - What compensating controls have you implemented to attempt to overcome/mitigate these issues (e.g., using web-safe colors).
